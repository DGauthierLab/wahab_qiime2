# wahab_qiime2
The cloned wahab_qiime2 directory should be renamed to whatever you like to distinguish it from additional clones. This will be your working directory for QIIME analysis
All commands should be run from inside the top directory (the one containing scripts/) and should look like: sbatch scripts/<whatever>.sbatch.
If you need to see what is in scripts, ls scripts/
